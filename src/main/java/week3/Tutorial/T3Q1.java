Consider the following problem:
A new candy machine is purchased for the cafeteria, but it is not working properly.
The candy machine has four dispensers to hold and release items sold by the candy machine
as well as a cash register.
The machine sells four products—candies, chips, gum, and cookies—each stored
in a separate dispenser.
You have been asked to write a program for this candy machine so that it can be put into operation.f
 */
/*
The program should do the following:
• Show the customer the different products sold by the candy machine.
• Let the customer make the selection.
• Show the customer the cost of the item selected.
• Accept the money from the customer.
• Return the change.
• Release the item, that is, make the sale.

You can see that the program you are about to write is supposed to deal with dispensers and cash
registers. That is, the main objects are four dispensers and a cash register.
 */
/*
Because all the dispensers are of the same type, you need to create a class, say, Dispenser, to create
the dispensers. Similarly, you need to create a class, say, CashRegister, to create a cash register.
You will create the class CandyMachine containing the four dispensers, a cash register, and the
application program.

Your tasks are to design ADTs to represent the three classes:
a. Identify the instance variables for each of the class (i.e. Dispenser, Cash Register, Candy
Machine)
b. Identify the methods/operations for each of the class (i.e. Dispenser, Cash Register, Candy
Machine)
c. Produce a UML class diagram to represent the three classes
