A bid for installing an air conditioner consists of the name of the company, a description of the
unit, the performance of the unit, the cost of the unit, and the cost of installation.
 */
/*
Design an ADT
that represents a single bid for installing an air conditioning unit.
Write a Java interface named BidInterface to specify the following ADT operations by stating its purpose,
precondition, post condition, parameters using javadoc-style comments:
• Returns the name of the company making this bid.
• Returns the description of the air conditioner that this bid is for.
• Returns the capacity of this bid's AC in tons (1 ton = 12,000 BTU).
• Returns the seasonal efficiency of this bid's AC (SEER).
• Returns the cost of this bid's AC.
• Returns the cost of installing this bid's AC.
• Returns the yearly cost of operating this bid's AC.
 */
/*
Then design another ADT to represent a collection of bids.
The second ADT should include methods to search for bids based on price and performance.
Also note that a single company could make multiple bids, each with a different unit.
Write a Java interface named BidCollectionInterface to specify the following ADT
operations by stating its purpose, precondition,
post condition, parameters using javadoc-style comments:
• Adds a bid to this collection.
• Returns the bid in this collection with the best yearly cost.
• Returns the bid in this collection with the best initial cost. The initial cost will be defined
  as the unit cost plus the installation cost.
• Clears all the items from this collection.
• Gets the number of items in this collection.
• Sees whether this collection is empty.
