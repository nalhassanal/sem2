/*
The union of two collections consists of their contents combined into a new collection. Add a
method union to the interface BagInterface for the ADT bag that returns as a new bag the
union of the bag receiving the call to the method and the bag that is the methodâ€™s one argument.
Include sufficient comments to fully specify the method.
Note that the union of two bags might contain duplicate items. For example, if object x occurs
five times in one bag and twice in another, the union of these bags contains x seven times.
Specifically, suppose that bag1 and bag2 are Bag objects, where Bag implements BagInterface;
bag1 contains the String objects a, b, and c; and bag2 contains the String objects b, b, d, and e.
After the statement
    BagInterface<String> everything = bag1.union(bag2);
executes, the bag everything contains the strings a, b, b, b, c, d, and e. Note that union does not
affect the contents of bag1 and bag2.
Implement the union method in ArrayBag class.
