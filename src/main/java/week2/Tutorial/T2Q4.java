4.	What is erasure? Why are Java generics implements using erasure?
    a.	Erasure is the process executed during compile time
        to replace all type parameters in generic types with their bounds
        or Object if the type parameters are unbounded.
    b.	Erasure prevents some means of violating parametricity,
        thus eliminating possibilities of incorrect programs, which is the goal of static typing.
        Therefore, ensures type safety of code and prevents runtime errors
