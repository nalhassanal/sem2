My name is Hassanal Harriz Bin Ahmed Hakimmy Fuad with matrix number, U2102848.
I am majoring in Computer Systems and Networking.
This is my first time taking Data Structure subject.
At the moment, I am feeling kind of excited about taking this subject.
This is because I feel like this subject is important for me to grow as a good programmer.

I acquired a B+ for my previous Programming 1 course. It's not too bad.
So, I think I can manage to get at least B+ for this subject this term.
In order to do well in the subject,
I will constantly learn from multiple sources and try out as many things as possible
and also discuss with my friends a lot more while doing tutorials and lab questions. Wish me luck!!!
